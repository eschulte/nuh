<p>The  National Union of the Homeless and the Nonviolent Medicaid Army, as part of the 2020 NUH Winter Offensive, will host a gathering lifting up the revolutionary work of Rev Dr Martin Luther King as he build the 1968 Poor Peoples Campaign. This event will highlight the original PPC and the organizing efforts today to build a movement to end poverty led by the poor and dispossessed that builds on the historical work of MLK during the last three years of his life (1965-1968) that ultimately led to his assassination. The event will feature speakers from the NUH, NVMA, and the  Poor Peoples campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival reading and reflecting on some of MLK's more famous quotes during his move from Civil Rights to Human Rights and his goal to build the Poor Peoples Campaign; a new and unsettling force!</p>

<p>This event will be streamed on the NUH Facebook Page and YouTube Channel.  We look forward to being with you at this powerful event in honor of MLK and the PPC</p>
