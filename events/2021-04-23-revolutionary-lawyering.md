On the evening of April 23, 2021, the National Lawyers Guild Committee
on Housing and Homelessness and the National Union of the Homeless
will co-host a nationwide online gathering to discuss the intersection
of law and the frontline struggle for housing during COVID-19 and
beyond.

Our focus will be on the role of the progressive and revolutionary
legal community within the process of the growing self-organization of
the poor and unhoused as homelessness explodes and mass evictions
loom. This will not be a technical "how to" event, but a broader
discussion of linking day-to-day "survival" work to the goal of
systemic change and housing as a legal entitlement.

We will have more information soon. In the meantime, we encourage the
submission of papers, opinions, legal filings, news stories, videos,
reports and publications from the camps, shelters, streets,
weekly-rate motels and other concentrations of the unhoused. We are
also encouraging suggestions for panelists.

We are also encouraging the co-sponsorship of homeless leaders, local
unions, legal associations and law student groups.
