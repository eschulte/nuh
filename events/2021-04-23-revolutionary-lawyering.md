On the evening of April 23, 2021, the National Union of the Homeless
and the Lawyers Guild Committee on Housing and Homelessness co-hosted
a nationwide online gathering to discuss the intersection of law and
the frontline struggle for housing during COVID-19 and beyond.

The focus of this gathering was the role of the progressive and
revolutionary legal community within the process of the growing
self-organization of the poor and unhoused as homelessness explodes
and mass evictions loom. This was not a technical "how to" event, but
a broader discussion of linking day-to-day "survival" work to the goal
of systemic change and housing as a legal entitlement.
