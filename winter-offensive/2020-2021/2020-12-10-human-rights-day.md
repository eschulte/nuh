The National Union of the Homeless and the National Welfare Rights
Union, as part of the NUH 2020 Winter Offensive, will host a Human
Rights Day Political Education and Panel Discussion Virtual Gathering
in celebration of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. This event will highlight the USA's history of struggle
for our basic needs as human rights such as housing, health, a living
wage, and an adequate standard of living and our general welfare. The
panel will include national organizers from various fronts of struggle
discussing their work to unite our class, build our politically
independent organization and build this movement led by the poor &
dispossessed as a united social force, across all lines of division to
end poverty and homelessness NOW.
