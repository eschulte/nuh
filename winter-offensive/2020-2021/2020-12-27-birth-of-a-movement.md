In our final Freedom Church of the Poor service of 2020 we continue to
focus on reclaiming the Christmas story. We are joined and led again
by leaders from the National Union of the Homeless as part of the
ongoing Winter Offensive. The struggles and leaders of the poor and
dispossessed help reveal the deeper revolutionary power of these
stories and this time of year.
