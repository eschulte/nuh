We are organizing ourselves as the poor and dispossessed to take back and keep our human rights to housing and health and to end homelessness and poverty and all forms of exploitation, racism, sexism, and abuse. Right now, we are in Durham and Raleigh and connecting with others all across the state.

Keep in touch with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61566395250840) or reach out to our lead organizers: Text/Call (919)335-3038 or email us at NCHomelessUnion@gmail.com

* You Only Get What You Are Organized to Take!
* Housing Now, Not Death in the Streets!
* You're only one paycheck or healthcare crisis from homelessness!
* Homeless, Not Helpless!
