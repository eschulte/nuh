  <p>The National Union of the Homeless and partners have launched our
2023/2024 National Winter Offensive Organizing Drive!</p>
<p>The Winter Offensive has been a powerful Organizing Drive since the
original National Union of the Homeless from the late 1980's to mid
1990’s and was relaunched in 2019 with the reestablishment of the
Union across the nation!</p>
<p>The National Winter Offensive season takes place annually from
Thanksgiving through the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr Day with key
dates throughout the season.</p>
<h2 id="important-winter-offensive-dates-around-which-actions-and-or-protests-will-take-place%3A">Important Winter Offensive dates around which actions and or protests will take place:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>December 10th – Anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of
Human Rights
(<a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">UDHR</a>)</strong>
particularly Article 23: Right to a Living Wage Job; Article 25:
Right to Housing and Health Care; and Article 26: Right to
Education. This year, 2023, marks the 75th Anniversary of the UDHR
and we will take this day to acknowledge the inspiration and
legitimation that the internationally recognized UDHR provides for
the National Union of the Homeless and its Mission Statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>December 21st – Annual National Homeless Memorial Day</strong> and
condemnation of mass graves of unnamed poor and homeless men,
women, and children in potters’ fields around the country and
internationally. We honor those we have lost due to this unjust
system that denies us our basic human rights and pledge to honor
them by continuing to unite and organize for our human rights for
all!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>December 25th - Birth of Jesus Christ</strong>, born a poor working
class unhoused child turned revolutionary, we commemorate his
Ministry, which was a Poor People’s Campaign that included
healthcare without co-pays. He educated and trained disciples,
making “fishers of men” who built a powerful social movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Year's Eve/Day</strong> and the making of <strong>Revolutionary
Resolutions</strong> or <em>Recommitments</em> for next year's work of the
National Homeless Union, its locals and partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>January 15th – Birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.</strong>  Commemorating the last year of his life where he began
uniting the poor across all lines of division to create a Poor
People’s Campaign to demand our human rights, the end to
militarism, the war economy, systemic poverty and systemic racism
and the redistribution of wealth!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-central-themes-and-slogans-of-the-winter-offensives-have-been%3A">The central themes and slogans of the Winter Offensives have been:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Right to Housing, Not Death in the Street!”</li>
